todotxt-status
==============

Todo.txt Status is based on a Ruby script by civrot (https://github.com/civrot/todo_txt_actions) to display a standup task list in the Todo.txt (http://todotxt.com/) ecosystem.

I tweaked his script to display yesterday's completed tasks, today's completed tasks, and then a display of the "A" level priority tasks. So it looks like this:

```
================================================================================
 Yesterday: 2013-12-07
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2013-10-23 This task was done yesterday
2013-10-18 So was this task
================================================================================
 Today: 2013-12-08
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2013-12-07 I did this today
2013-12-07 I also did this today
================================================================================
02 (A) 2013-10-01 You better do this right away.
39 (A) 2013-12-07 This is also very important.

```
